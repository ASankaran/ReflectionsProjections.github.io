Teams do not need to be comprised of all students from the same school, but all participants must be actively enrolled in a college or university.\nCorporate Competition: The corporate competition is open to teams representing companies. Be sure to contact us if your company is interested in participating in this year's competition. There are no prizes (other than the joy of winning) for corporate competitors.")

A mobile device (smartphone, laptop, tablet, dumbphone with a friend at a computer on the other end, etc) with internet capabilities might be useful for Friday and Saturday."

All members should be proficient in the programming language their team intends to use. The API will use JSON messages passed over HTTP, so we recommend having knowledge of a JSON library in your chosen language."

You won't need a background in artificial intelligenceâ€”in previous years, many teams without an AI background have competed and done well, or even won. You also shouldn't need knowledge of network programming beyond HTTP requests."

You may, however, bring non-code items like rc files, build scripts, notes, etc. Competitors are allowed to bring their own laptops, though the code you write must be capable of running on our systems."

We will provide a standard Unix environment, as described above. You will have access to the internet throughout the competition and are free to find reference materials, documentation and third party libraries."

                "answer": "By either starting from scratch or using our provided sample clients, you will build an artificial intelligence client to play a strategy game of our design. Our API will provide you information about the current state of the game, as well as allow you to send commands to play it. You may find previous competition sites useful to get an idea of how MechMania operates."

The competition will begin with the opening ceremony and announcement of the game on Friday, October 5, after which the programming component will commence immediately. The competition will end Saturday evening after running for 24 hours. We will present the closing ceremony and awards Sunday afternoon."
